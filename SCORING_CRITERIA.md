# Scoring Criteria (Rubrics)

All dimensions are scored on a **1–10 scale**.  
Each dimension should be evaluated **independently**.

- 1 = very poor
- 10 = excellent
- Do NOT try to keep scores similar across dimensions

Focus on **plot structure and emotional dynamics**, not writing quality.

## 1. Surprise

**What it measures**  
How unexpected the plot developments are **given prior context and genre conventions**.

This dimension evaluates narrative novelty and effective deviation from predictable patterns.

### Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Criteria |
|------|---------|
| 1–2 | Fully predictable, formulaic, cliché |
| 3–4 | Minor deviations, mostly expected |
| 5–6 | Some meaningful turns, but not striking |
| 7–8 | Multiple effective twists that remain coherent |
| 9–10 | Highly novel, consistently surprising yet logically justified |

**Key Question**  
> Did the plot meaningfully surprise you without breaking plausibility?

---

## 2. Valence

**What it measures**  
The overall **emotional polarity** of the plot: positive vs. negative.

> IMPORTANT:  
> Valence is about **direction**, not intensity.  
> Do NOT confuse this with Arousal.

### Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Criteria |
|------|---------|
| 1–2 | Strongly negative, bleak, despair-driven |
| 3–4 | Predominantly negative |
| 5–6 | Mixed or emotionally balanced |
| 7–8 | Predominantly positive |
| 9–10 | Strongly positive, uplifting, hopeful |

**Key Question**  
> Does the story leave a negative, neutral, or positive emotional impression overall?

---

## 3. Arousal

**What it measures**  
The level of **emotional intensity, tension, and activation** throughout the plot.

This dimension captures how *stimulating* or *calm* the narrative feels.

### Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Criteria |
|------|---------|
| 1–2 | Very flat, emotionally inactive |
| 3–4 | Low intensity, occasional tension |
| 5–6 | Moderate intensity with noticeable peaks |
| 7–8 | Sustained high tension and emotional energy |
| 9–10 | Extremely intense, emotionally gripping throughout |

**Key Question**  
> How tense, urgent, or emotionally activating does the plot feel?

---

## 4. Dominance

**What it measures**  
The degree of **agency and control** characters have over the narrative trajectory.

This reflects whether outcomes are driven by **character decisions** or by **fate, randomness, or external forces**.

### Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Criteria |
|------|---------|
| 1–2 | Characters are powerless; fate/environment dominates |
| 3–4 | Characters attempt control but mostly fail |
| 5–6 | Mixed agency and external constraint |
| 7–8 | Characters actively shape outcomes |
| 9–10 | Strong agency; characters decisively control the plot |

**Key Question**  
> Are events mainly caused by character choices or by forces beyond their control?

---

## 5. Conflict

**What it measures**  
The **strength and diversity of conflicts** present in the plot.

Consider conflicts such as:
- Person vs. Person  
- Person vs. Self  
- Person vs. Environment / Society  

### Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Criteria |
|------|---------|
| 1–2 | Weak or trivial conflict |
| 3–4 | Single dominant conflict |
| 5–6 | Multiple conflicts with limited interaction |
| 7–8 | Diverse conflicts that escalate and interact |
| 9–10 | Rich, multi-layered conflicts driving the narrative |

**Key Question**  
> Does the plot involve varied and meaningful sources of tension?

---

## 6. Coherence

**What it measures**  
The **causal plausibility and logical consistency** of the entire plot.

This dimension evaluates whether events follow a believable cause–effect structure.

### Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Criteria |
|------|---------|
| 1–2 | Illogical, disconnected, contradictory |
| 3–4 | Partially coherent with major gaps |
| 5–6 | Mostly coherent with minor issues |
| 7–8 | Strong causal logic and narrative flow |
| 9–10 | Exceptionally consistent and well-structured |

**Key Question**  
> Do events follow from one another in a clear and believable way?

---

## 7. Overall

**What it measures**  
Your **holistic judgment** of the plot as a dramatic structure.

Do not mechanically average other scores.  
Instead, consider overall engagement, emotional impact, and structural quality.

### Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Criteria |
|------|---------|
| 1–2 | Fundamentally ineffective plot |
| 3–4 | Weak but with some redeeming elements |
| 5–6 | Adequate, serviceable plot |
| 7–8 | Strong and engaging |
| 9–10 | Exceptional dramatic structure |

## General Rules (Please Follow)

- Judge **structure and dynamics**, not prose quality
- Use the **full 1–10 scale**
- Do not compare with previously seen plots
- Keep dimensions conceptually separate

You are acting as a **plot analyst**, not a proofreader.
